You are going to recreate the front page of a newspaper using block, inline and inline-block elements

Your newspaper should have:

A header with the name of your newspaper

A title for the front page article

A classifieds sections. Each classified add should have a border. Some of them should have images. Feel free to add more or be creative with this section.

A body with a story.

Several words in the body should be individually styled using inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)

Come up with your own story. It can be anything, including satire or the recreation of an existing article somewhere. Make sure it looks nice so that someone could obviously tell it's suppose to be a newspaper.

Change this up - they make the "Classifieds" section of the newspaper. TItle at top (block), classifieds cards with borders (inline-block), some of them should have images (inline), whatever else they want to add
