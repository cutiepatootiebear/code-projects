/**
 * The reducer's job is to take the old info from the store and update it
 * with the new data from the action that the dispatcher gave it.
 * It's conceptually equivalent to React's setState method.
 *
 * The reducer function takes 2 parameters: the current version of
 * state and the action object that the dispatcher gave it
 *
 * The reducer should look at the action object and determine
 * what to do based on the action's type property. Handled by the below switch
 *
 * calling another function and takes dispatch serves the reducer an action is going to be created
 * The dispatcher sends actions to the reducer.
 * middleware handle dispatching actions asyncronously
