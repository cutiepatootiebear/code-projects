                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">DOM</abbr>s, broken
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>

                    <p class="para2">We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts
                        of folk like the
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">W3C, WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>

                    <p class="para1"> There is a continuing need to show the power of
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some
                        of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very
                        page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>

                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way
                        this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be,
                        once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
                        coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                    <h3> Requirements</h3>
                    <p> Where possible, we would like to see mostly
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS 1 & 2 </abbr> usage.
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS 3 & 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should
                        be provided. The
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Zen Garden is about functional, practical
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
                        real requirement we have is that your
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>

                <section class="paragraph-two">
                    <p> Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented
                        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across
                        most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when
                        you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay,
                        but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
                        Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
